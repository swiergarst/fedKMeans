abstract = {In this work, we explore the unique challenges-and opportunities-of unsupervised federated learning (FL). We develop and analyze a one-shot federated clustering scheme, k-FED, based on the widely-used Lloyd's method for k-means clustering. In contrast to many supervised problems, we show that the issue of statistical heterogene-ity in federated networks can in fact benefit our analysis. We analyse k-FED under a center separation assumption and compare it to the best known requirements of its centralized counterpart. Our analysis shows that in heterogeneous regimes where the number of clusters per device pk 1 q is smaller than the total number of clusters over the network k, pk 1 ƒè ? kq, we can use heterogene-ity to our advantage-significantly weakening the cluster separation requirements for k-FED. From a practical viewpoint, k-FED also has many desirable properties: it requires only one round of communication, can run asynchronously, and can handle partial participation or node/network failures. We motivate our analysis with experiments on common FL benchmarks, and highlight the practical utility of one-shot clustering through use-cases in personalized FL and device sampling.},

big difference: they either assume that a value for k for each client is known, or they just take some value for all of them.},

abstract = {As a commonly used algorithm in data mining, clustering has been widely applied in many fields, such as machine learning, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. In reality, data to be analyzed are often distributed to multiple parties. Moreover, the rapidly increasing data volume puts heavy computing pressure on data owners. .us, data owners tend to outsource their own data to cloud servers and obtain data analysis results for the federated data. However, the existing privacy-preserving outsourced k-means schemes cannot verify whether participants share consistent data. Considering the scenarios with multiple data owners and sensitive information security in an outsourced environment, we propose a verifiable privacy-preserving federated k-means clustering scheme. In this article, cloud servers and participants perform k-means clustering algorithm over encrypted data without exposing private data and intermediate results in each iteration. In particular, our scheme can verify the shares from participants when updating the cluster centers based on secret sharing, hash function and blockchain, so that our scheme can resist inconsistent share attacks by malicious participants. Finally, the security and experimental analysis are carried out to show that our scheme can protect private data and get high-accuracy clustering results.},

abstract = {Proactive caching is a novel smart communication resource management method that can offer intelligent and economic networking services in the next generation cellular networks. In proactive caching, a common operation is using k-means to estimate content popularity. However, during the process, the base stations have to collect user's location and content preference information to train a k-means model, which causes user privacy leakage. And current privacy-preserving k-means schemes usually suffer dramatic user quality of experience reduction, and cannot deal with the user dropout condition. Therefore, we propose a privacy-preserving federated k-means scheme (named PFK-means) for proactive caching in the next generation cellular networks. PFK-means is based on two privacy-preserving techniques, federated learning and secret sharing. In PFK-means, a suite of secret sharing protocols are designed to lightweight and efficient federated learning of k-means. These protocols allow privacy-preserving k-means training for proactive caching when there are dropout users. We seriously analyze the security of PFK-means and conduct comprehensive experiments to prove its security, effectiveness and efficiency. Through comparison, we can conclude that PFK-means outperforms other existing related schemes.},

abstract = {Edge AI is the result of a more fundamental thought, "bring code to data, not data to code". The assumption here is that the data is stored on devices which are computationally powerful and are therefore 'edge devices'. Our paper deals with the technique of Federated Averaging applied to 'Federated k-Means' algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, at the time of writing, there is no published research outcome of applying Federated k-Means, a computing paradigm aligned towards this concept of Edge AI. The data generated at the edge device never leaves it, thus ensuring privacy preservation. Each device has a ML model on it, thus reducing the latency associated with a centralized model deployed on the cloud. Our paper aims to provide a holistic analysis of the performance metrics at the edge devices as well as at the central server after each federation step. Ours is an early publication of the research results, aiming to excite the researcher community on the immense possibilities to explore this new area, a possible solution to the concerns of user data privacy and the inherent latency associated with traditional ML approaches. The findings of our paper can potentially be applied to a privacy-preserving real-world use case, such as EMR (Electronic Medical Record) based ML applications.},
