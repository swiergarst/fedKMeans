abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has become a practical and popular paradigm in machine learning. However, currently, there is no systematic solution that covers diverse use cases. Practitioners often face the challenge of how to select a matching FL framework for their use case. In this work, we present UniFed, the first unified benchmark for standardized evaluation of the existing open-source FL frameworks. With 15 evaluation scenarios, we present both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results of nine existing popular open-sourced FL frameworks, from the perspectives of functionality, usability, and system performance. We also provide suggestions on framework selection based on the benchmark conclusions and point out future improvement directions.},
